        <div class="lead-artice__body">
            <p>It&rsquo;s late evening. Associate professor of communication <strong>Nicola Corbin</strong> receives an email from a former student, asking for advice on how to improve a job acceptance letter. Instead of waiting to address the email the next morning, Corbin happily responds, suggesting revisions that, ultimately, help the student negotiate a higher salary. &ldquo;At 10 p.m. her time!&rdquo; the student emphasized in a letter nominating Corbin for a 2019 Crystal Crest Master Teacher award.</p>

            <p>Corbin&rsquo;s authenticity, passion, enthusiasm and genuine concern for the success of each student guide all of her interactions, inside and outside the classroom. These qualities led to her winning the Master Teacher award at the Crystal Crest ceremony on April 13.</p>

            <p>As a teacher, Corbin engages students in enriching experiences and discussions. As an adviser for Ogden Peak Communications, WSU&rsquo;s student-run public relations firm, Corbin builds connections between students and the community. Within the context of learning, Corbin says she listens to students. She allows for questions, particularly the politically incorrect ones, and is honest in her responses.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;My students learn from me, and I continue to learn from my students,&rdquo; Corbin said. &ldquo;It is truly a symbiotic relationship, and it is why I absolutely adore my career. By motivating and supporting my students, I reap the same benefits they do &mdash; widening of perspective, the challenge of always engaging in critical thinking and of seeing each person as an individual with different needs.&rdquo;</p>

                <div>
                    <p>If you ever felt compelled to check Facebook and then logged off feeling lonelier than when you signed in, you&rsquo;re actually not alone. Recent research by Weber State professors shows that our digital habits affect both our moods and behaviors.</p>

                    <p><strong>Jeff Clements</strong>, business administration assistant professor, and <strong>Randy Boyle</strong>, associate professor of management information systems, in the John B. Goddard School of Business &amp; Economics, published &ldquo;Compulsive Technology Use: Compulsive Use of Mobile Applications&rdquo; in the journal Computers in Human Behavior, examining the habitual use of technology and when a habit turns into a compulsion.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;There are things about a person&rsquo;s psychology that can be manipulated by very smart designers and mobile app developers that can strengthen compulsive behaviors,&rdquo; Clements said.</p>

                    <p>It is no mystery that compulsive technology use can affect our moods, as computing assistant professor <strong>Luke Fernandez</strong> and his spouse, history professor <strong>Susan Matt</strong>, discovered.</p>

                    <p>Fernandez and Matt&rsquo;s research showed emotions such as loneliness, boredom, vanity, awe and anger have changed or been redefined as people have interacted with new technologies throughout history. Their research is published in their book Bored, Lonely, Angry, Stupid: Changing Feelings about Technology, from the Telegraph to Twitter.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;In the past, people expected that there would be limits on their experiences; limits on how much they could learn, be entertained or interact with others,&rdquo; Fernandez said. &ldquo;By contrast, many today have developed a limitless sense of self in comparison to previous generations, meaning they expect unending affirmation, infinite social contacts, never ending entertainment and the right to unrestrained anger.&rdquo;</p>

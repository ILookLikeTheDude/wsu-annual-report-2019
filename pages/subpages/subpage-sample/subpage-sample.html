            <p><b>Victoria &ldquo;Toria&rdquo; Snow&rsquo;s</b> triumphant Feb. 16 Facebook post read: &ldquo;I came, I tried, and I WON!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s how the WSU theatre design student announced to friends, family and &ldquo;followers&rdquo; that she was one of eight regional finalists for the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival&rsquo;s (KCACTF) national award for excellence in costume design.</p>

            <p>On April 20, Snow&rsquo;s news got even better. She became the first WSU student costume designer to capture a KCACTF grand prize for her work on the WSU Theatre production of The Cripple of Inishmaan, a play that takes place on Ireland&rsquo;s isolated isle of Inishmaan, where inhabitants observe ancient customs and wear traditional clothing.</p>

            <p>Snow&rsquo;s costume designs included pampooties, rawhide moccasins worn by men on the isle, and Aran sweaters, which traditionally feature intricate patterns that were zealously guarded by the same clan throughout generations.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I used natural fibers and earth tones to convey a realistic feel,&rdquo; Snow explained to KCACTF judges. &ldquo;But each character had a pop of color to help them stand out.&rdquo; To become the best, Snow had to learn from the best. In 2014, she enrolled at Weber State specifically to study with professor <strong>Catherine Zublin</strong>, who received a 2018 KCACTF gold medallion &mdash; the organization&rsquo;s most prestigious regional award &mdash; for her outstanding efforts in encouraging young artists to develop their talents and pursue their dreams. Snow also worked closely with assistant professor <strong>Samantha &ldquo;Sam&rdquo; Transleau</strong>, who supervised her senior project, an outdoor art installation in Southern Utah.</p>

            <p>Snow&rsquo;s KCACTF award package included a trip to Washington, D.C., $500 and a trip to the 2019 Prague Quadrennial of Performance Design and Space. She graduated from WSU in April 2019, and is currently pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree in costume design at California State University Fullerton.</p>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>By creating three large-scale art installations in Ogden, 2018 Hurst Artist-in-Residence Jane Kim
                    connected northern Utah to the Migrating Mural campaign, a nationwide art initiative highlighting
                    endangered animals along migration corridors they share with humans. The Ogden Migrating Murals are part of a larger network of monarch butterfly-inspired murals across the country. Ogden is a pit stop along  the monarch’s epic 3,000-mile North American migration path.</p>
                <p>The project began at the Ogden Nature Center with six banners depicting the monarch’s life
                    cycle. The next phase was a mural painted on the exterior walls of The Monarch, a new event space in
                    downtown Ogden. For the third phase, Kim and her team selected three student interns from the
                    Lindquist College of Arts & Humanities to help produce a monochrome mural for the Kimball Visual Arts Center atrium.</p>
                <p>Kim hopes the Ogden murals will create awareness about the monarch’s endangered status and
                    inspire widespread conservationism.</p>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>Using two simple materials — plastic sheeting and hot glue — internationally acclaimed Japanese artist Yasuaki Onishi created what appeared to be a vast, floating mountainscape inside the Mary Elizabeth Dee Shaw Gallery. In a process he calls casting the invisible, Onishi draped semi-translucent plastic over stacked cardboard boxes, suspended the mass with wispy strands of black glue, then removed the boxes. Reverse of Volume, described as a meditation on the nature of negative space, was on display from Feb. 8 to April 6, 2019.

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>The inaugural season of Browning Presents! (formerly the Office of Cultural Affairs) began on a high note with a performance by the Sean Jones Quartet. Famed trumpeter, composer, educator and activist Sean Jones taught master classes on campus prior to the Sept. 14, 2018, concert. He told students that jazz music tells America’s story and can help us all become better human beings.
                    Other Browning Presents! events during the 2018–19 academic year included a conversation with Pulitzer Prize winner Ronan Farrow and a performance by the Choir of Clare College, Cambridge.

            <p>It was a great year for Weber State hurdler <strong>Tawnie Moore</strong>, who set school and Big Sky Conference records in the 100-meter hurdles, culminating in an 11th-place finish at the NCAA Championships and second-team All-America honors. She is the first hurdler in WSU history &mdash; male or female &mdash; to earn All-America honors in a hurdles event.</p>

            <p>Wildcat senior <strong>Nathan Dunivan</strong> finished 10th in the NCAA discus event with a personal best mark of 189 feet, 5 inches to improve his school record. He also earned second-team All-America honors.</p>

                    <p>Weber State football built on its successful 2017 campaign, repeating as Big Sky Conference champions in 2018 en route to another FCS quarterfinals appearance. The Wildcats finished the season ranked No. 6 in the country in the STATS FCS poll, winning 10 or more games in back-to-back years for the first time in school history. WSU entered the playoffs as the No. 2 overall seed, also a program best.</p>

                    <p>Individually, the Wildcats had a school record 13 players named to the Big Sky All-Conference first team, seven of whom also earned All-America honors. Leading the way was freshman running back <strong>Josh Davis</strong>, who set a WSU freshman record with 1,362 rushing yards and 10 total touchdowns. His efforts earned him the Jerry Rice Award as the National Freshman of the Year. He was also named Utah Male Collegiate Athlete of the Year at Utah Gov. Gary Herbert&rsquo;s State of Sports Awards. As the Wildcats attempt a three-peat in 2019, they will do so with a new look to their home field. In September, Weber State broke ground on a 27,000-square-foot athletics complex in Stewart Stadium&rsquo;s north end zone. The new building will include the Barbara and Rory Youngberg Football Center, the Sark&rsquo;s Boys Gateway, the Stromberg Strength and Conditioning Complex, the Marquardt-Kimball Plaza and the Behnken Plaza. The project opened in advance of the 2019 home-opener.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The Weber State Spirit Squad trophy case is getting crowded.</p>

                <p>WSU&rsquo;s cheer team won its third consecutive national title at the 2019 NCA Collegiate Cheer Championships in Daytona Beach, Florida. It was the Wildcats&rsquo; fifth national championship in eight years. WSU cheer partners <strong>Mekenzie Grabau</strong> and <strong>Kollin Cockrell</strong> also claimed the Coed Partner title at the competition.</p>

                <p>Waldo defended his 2018 crown as the nation&rsquo;s top mascot, edging &ldquo;Truman the Tiger&rdquo; from the Southeastern Conference&rsquo;s University of Missouri, to earn his third national title in five seasons.</p>

            <div>
                <p>After a successful regular season &mdash; the Wildcats won the Big Sky Conference regular-season softball crown for the fourth straight year &mdash; and a dominating win in the 2019 Big Sky Conference championship game, defeating Northern Colorado 8&ndash;0, the Wildcats earned a trip to the NCAA Tournament in Los Angeles. There, they picked up a 7&ndash;3 win over Cal State Fullerton and became the first team in school and conference history to win an NCAA regional game. The season later ended at the hands of the University of Missouri.</p>

                <p>2019 also saw the Wildcats, led by league MVP <strong>Takesha Saltern</strong>, set a Big Sky win-percentage record with a 14&ndash;2 mark in conference play.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Weber State women&rsquo;s soccer had an incredible turnaround in 2018, earning the Big Sky Conference regular-season championship after a 10th-place finish in 2017, the biggest statistical improvement in conference history. The Wildcats piled up a school-record seven league wins (7&ndash;1&ndash;1 Big Sky, 9&ndash;4&ndash;4 overall) on their way to their first regular-season title since 2008 and their first title of any kind since 2013. With the help of nine All-Big Sky selections, head coach <strong>Tim Crompton</strong> bagged his third Big Sky Coach of the Year honor.</p>

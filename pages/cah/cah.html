            <p><b>Victoria &ldquo;Toria&rdquo; Snow&rsquo;s</b> triumphant Feb. 16 Facebook post read: &ldquo;I came, I tried, and I WON!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s how the WSU theatre design student announced to friends, family and &ldquo;followers&rdquo; that she was one of eight regional finalists for the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival&rsquo;s (KCACTF) national award for excellence in costume design.</p>

            <p>On April 20, Snow&rsquo;s news got even better. She became the first WSU student costume designer to capture a KCACTF grand prize for her work on the WSU Theatre production of The Cripple of Inishmaan, a play that takes place on Ireland&rsquo;s isolated isle of Inishmaan, where inhabitants observe ancient customs and wear traditional clothing.</p>

            <p>Snow&rsquo;s costume designs included pampooties, rawhide moccasins worn by men on the isle, and Aran sweaters, which traditionally feature intricate patterns that were zealously guarded by the same clan throughout generations.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I used natural fibers and earth tones to convey a realistic feel,&rdquo; Snow explained to KCACTF judges. &ldquo;But each character had a pop of color to help them stand out.&rdquo; To become the best, Snow had to learn from the best. In 2014, she enrolled at Weber State specifically to study with professor <strong>Catherine Zublin</strong>, who received a 2018 KCACTF gold medallion &mdash; the organization&rsquo;s most prestigious regional award &mdash; for her outstanding efforts in encouraging young artists to develop their talents and pursue their dreams. Snow also worked closely with assistant professor <strong>Samantha &ldquo;Sam&rdquo; Transleau</strong>, who supervised her senior project, an outdoor art installation in Southern Utah.</p>

            <p>Snow&rsquo;s KCACTF award package included a trip to Washington, D.C., $500 and a trip to the 2019 Prague Quadrennial of Performance Design and Space. She graduated from WSU in April 2019, and is currently pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree in costume design at California State University Fullerton.</p>

            <h2 class="regular-article__title">Migration Captured in Mural</h2>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>By creating three large-scale art installations in Ogden, 2018 Hurst Artist-in-Residence Jane Kim connected northern Utah to the Migrating Mural campaign, a nationwide art initiative highlighting endangered animals along migration corridors they share with humans. The Ogden Migrating Murals are part of a larger network of monarch butterfly-inspired murals across the country. Ogden is a pit stop along ?the monarch&rsquo;s epic 3,000-mile North American migration path.</p>

                <p>The project began at the Ogden Nature Center with six banners depicting the monarch&rsquo;s life cycle. The next phase was a mural painted on the exterior walls of The Monarch, a new event space in downtown Ogden. For the third phase, Kim and her team selected three student interns from the Lindquist College of Arts &amp; Humanities to help produce a monochrome mural for the Kimball Visual Arts Center atrium.</p>

                <p>Kim hopes the Ogden murals will create awareness about the monarch&rsquo;s endangered status and inspire widespread conservationism.</p>

                <div class="regular-article__body">
                    <p>Using two simple materials &mdash; plastic sheeting and hot glue &mdash; internationally acclaimed Japanese artist Yasuaki Onishi created what appeared to be a vast, floating mountainscape inside the Mary Elizabeth Dee Shaw Gallery. In a process he calls casting the invisible, Onishi draped semi-translucent plastic over stacked cardboard boxes, suspended the mass with wispy strands of black glue, then removed the boxes. Reverse of Volume, described as a meditation on the nature of negative space, was on display from Feb. 8 to April 6, 2019.</p>

        <div class="regular-article__body">
            <p>The inaugural season of Browning Presents! (formerly the Office of Cultural Affairs) began on a high note with a performance by the Sean Jones Quartet.

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>When WSU family communication student <strong>Bianca Morales</strong> joined the Weber State Debate team in 2013, speaking was her weakest skill. At the 2019 Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA) National Tournament, she walked away as the second-place speaker in the nation and an All-American.&nbsp; &ldquo;I worked hard with my coach to improve,&rdquo; Morales said. &ldquo;I was blown away and brought to tears by this accomplishment.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Morales&rsquo; distinction was not all WSU brought home from the CEDA National Tournament. Weber State Debate also won first place in the western region sweepstakes. Debate coach <strong>Ryan Wash</strong> was awarded Critic of the Year for the western region. Students <strong>Roey Sellouk, Zachary Baker </strong>and<strong> Jordan Stephens</strong> received the National Debate Scholar recognition, awarded to those who, in addition to competitive accomplishments, maintain a strong academic record.</p>
